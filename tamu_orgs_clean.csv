We are an organization in the service of over 800 Indian graduate students on-campus at Texas A&M University. Our student leaders have recognized that the issues faced by Indian graduate students and their needs are unique to this demographic. These students come from varied backgrounds, and face many challenges with transitioning to a distinctly new system of rules and procedures. With a view to addressing these issues, our mission is based on the following key objectives: 1) Advocacy : Many Indian graduate students face serious challenges in coping with the pressures of university requirements, and on many occasions, they are unaware of the resources available on campus to help resolve their issues. Consequently, there needs to be an organization that can lend a voice to this group of students, and also promote involvement at forums aimed towards university-level policy planning efforts. With these aims in mind, IGSA works with agencies like the OGS and GSC, among others, to facilitate their efforts with a focused group of the campus community. 2) Networking : There is an urgent need to develop and maintain a strong networking resource that includes members from the current graduate school community, academia, industry professionals and the alumni. It is of utmost importance for the graduate students to be well-informed about the developments pertaining to their experiences at graduate school and beyond. Through events like socials, information sessions and others, IGSA offers a students a platform to develop a strong network base that is both resourceful as well as engaging. 3) Mentoring : Mentorship at the departmental level is crucial for the success of our graduate students. Incoming Indian graduate students need guidance to step into the daily routines and workings of the department/courses/research. IGSA has departmental points-of-contact for all the major departments and schools on campus who can help the students based on their personal experiences and valuable resources in the form of other similar departmental representatives.

The group was initially brought together by Manuel Chrysaloras, a Greek scholar that taught at the University, in response to physical attack, robbery and harassment of the University's patrons. It was this group that inspired the Ritual and beliefs of modern day Kappa Sigma.In 1980 a group of Texas A&M Students, our Founding Fathers, accepted Jackson's challenge by introducing the principles and traditions of Kappa Sigma to Texas A&M University. Kappa Sigma was one of the earliest Fraternities established at Texas A&M.After two years of diligently committing themselves to the Order, our founding members recruited a sufficient number of model students that shared the ideals of our Fraternity, and were granted an official Charter. As a result of their dedication, the Mu-Gamma Chapter of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity was born on May 8, 1982.Now, over 40 years later, Mu Gamma continues to have a strong presence at Texas A&M.

Amidst the political and social revolutions surrounding the Feminist Liberation and Civil Rights Movements of the sixties and seventies, our 17 Founding Mothers recognized the need to combat machismo attitudes and racial prejudice by gaining a voice in the collegiate realm. Responding to this need, Lambda Theta Alpha was established upon the principles of Unity, Love, and Respect. They created a support system to empower the Universal Woman while upholding scholarly excellence, cultural and political awareness, and community activism. Although LTA was the first sorority to cater to the needs of the Latina woman, not all 17 Founding Mothers were of Latin descent. We follow the motto, ""Latin by Tradition, nor by definition"", with sisters representing over 120 different cultural identities across the nation. Today, we have over 175 chapters in the United States and in Puerto Rico, making us the largest, and one of the most respected, Latina-based organizations in the nation.","cultural activities, educational programs, Latinos, leadership, political activities, sisterhood, social activities",Undergraduate Students

LG [Lumen Gentium] 69). MI members live their own baptismal consecration by welcoming the gift of the Redeemer from the Cross: “Behold your Mother” (Jn 19:27). They entrust and give themselves completely to the Immaculata with a view to their own sanctification and in order to collaborate in Mary’s maternal mission to direct the heart of each person toward Christ. On Calvary, Christ Himself accomplishes the first act of entrusting, giving the disciple to Mary and Mary to the disciple (cf. Jn 19:25-27), 1 and thus the life of the disciple, from that moment, is characterized by her maternal presence (cf. RM [Redemptoris Mater] 45). One of the ways in which the special entrusting of a person to the Mother of Christ has been practiced and expressed within the history of the Church is that of Saint Maximilian Kolbe. He lived that vital, dynamic relationship with Mary in a unique way, understood as becoming “changed into her, transubstantiated into her” (KW 508), in order to reach a more perfect union with Christ and in order to point Him out to all people, as she did (cf.
